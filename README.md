# üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ Munin

Munin is a physical, dice-like Bluetooth time tracker. Each face represents a different activity ‚Äî just flip the cube to start logging time.  
It‚Äôs 3D-printed, powered by a Seeed XIAO board, and designed to be **subscription-free and hackable**.

## Hardware
The device consists of a 3d printed translucent enclosure, a single board for control and connectivity, plus a battery.

- 3D-printed translucent enclosure (STL to come)
- [Seeed XIAO nRF54L15 Sense]([https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-nRF52840-Sense-p-5201.html](https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-nRF54L15-Sense-p-6494.html)) ‚Äî BLE + IMU + USB-C microcontroller
- LiPo battery (3.7‚ÄØV, 400‚Äì1000‚ÄØmAh)

### LED feedback
The internal LED provides status feedback:

- Face switch confirmation (short glow in configured color)
- Low battery (pulsing red)
- Bluetooth pairing mode
- Charging (pulsing green) and fully charged (steady green)

### Bluetooth pairing
Pairing is triggered when the USB-C connector side is UP and USB is connected.

## Software
The Munin time tracker is paired via bluetooth and has a CLI based app that handles configuration and writes to a log file.
