# üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ Munin

Munin helps you track time for different tasks during your work day. Each face represents a different activity ‚Äî just flip the cube to start logging time for a specific task (ex. _"Product support"_, _"Emails"_, _"Coding"_ etc). Add labels to each side if you want.

* 3D-printed
* Bluetooth connected
* Subscription-free (unlike for example Timeular and EARLY)
* Hackable

Depending on usage, battery time should be 2-8 weeks.

## Hardware
The device consists of a 3d printed translucent enclosure, a single board for control and connectivity, plus a battery.

- 3D-printed translucent enclosure (STL to come)
- Seeed XIAO nRF52840 Sense ‚Äî BLE + IMU + USB-C microcontroller
- LiPo battery (3.7‚ÄØV, EEMB 803030 with PCM)

Total cost of components is something like 40‚Ç¨ at the moment. Could be lowered significantly but that would make assembly much more cumbersome.

### LED feedback
The internal LED provides status feedback:

- :rainbow: Face switch confirmation (short glow in configured color)
- :red_square: Low battery (pulsing red)
- :green_square: Charging (pulsing green) and fully charged (steady green)
- :blue_square: Bluetooth pairing mode

### Bluetooth pairing
Pairing is triggered when the USB-C connector side is UP and USB is connected.

## Software
The Munin time tracker has, besides its own firmware, a CLI based app that handles connectivity, configuration and writes to a log file. The app is based on python and `bleak` and will work on macOS, Windows and Linux. It will not require root and will probably be distributed using something like `pipx install munin-client`. We shall see.
