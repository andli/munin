# üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ Munin

Munin helps you track time for different tasks during your work day. Each face represents a different activity ‚Äî just flip the cube to start logging time for a specific task (ex. _"Product support"_, _"Emails"_, _"Coding"_ etc). Add labels to each side if you want.

* 3D-printed
* Bluetooth connected
* Subscription-free (unlike for example Timeular and EARLY)
* Hackable

Depending on usage, battery time should be 2-8 weeks.

## Hardware
The device consists of a 3d printed translucent enclosure, a single board for control and connectivity, plus a battery.

- 3D-printed translucent enclosure (STL to come)
- Seeed XIAO nRF52840 Sense ‚Äî BLE + IMU + USB-C microcontroller
- LiPo battery (3.7‚ÄØV, EEMB 803030 with PCM)

Total cost of components is something like 40‚Ç¨ at the moment. Could be lowered significantly but that would make assembly much more cumbersome.

### LED feedback
The internal LED provides status feedback:

- :rainbow: Face switch confirmation (short glow in configured color)
- :red_square: Low battery (pulsing red)
- :green_square: Charging (pulsing green) and fully charged (steady green)
- :blue_square: Bluetooth pairing mode

### Bluetooth pairing
Pairing is triggered when the USB-C connector side is UP and USB is connected.

## Software
The Munin time tracker has, besides its own firmware, a systray client app that handles connectivity, configuration and writes to a log file. The app is based on python and `bleak` and will work on macOS, Windows and Linux. It will not require root and will probably be distributed using something like `pipx install munin-client`. We shall see.

### Log file format
These are mockups of how the logs will look (probably).

```

### Configuration
- Label and color for each side.
- Time log file location

Face colors can be configured in the `~/.munin/config.json` file. The client automatically sends the configured colors to the device when connecting. Each face has a default color:
- Face 1: Red (255,0,0)
- Face 2: Green (0,255,0) 
- Face 3: Blue (0,0,255)
- Face 4: Yellow (255,255,0)
- Face 5: Magenta (255,0,255)
- Face 6: Gray (128,128,128)

The device will flash the configured color briefly when switching faces.


## Dev
Test locally: 

`pipx run --spec . munin-client`

# Roadmap
## Client app
* Test client app on Windows
* ~~Log face change to log file (CSV format as specified above)~~ ‚úÖ
* ~~Handle device reconnection when connection is lost~~ ‚úÖ
* Implement face color configuration UI in system tray
* Add preferred device selection/pairing UI
* Implement a basic view for time tracking statistics and reports

## Munin device
* ~~Broadcast face change only on movement instead of every 1000 ms~~ ‚úÖ 
* ~~Broadcast battery level periodically (currently simulated - reduce frequency)~~ ‚úÖ
* ~~Receive LED configuration from client~~ ‚úÖ
* ~~Light up LED on face change~~ ‚úÖ
* Power saving mode - "sleep" and wake on movement
* Optimize BLE connection parameters for battery life
* Implement real battery voltage reading (ADC) - when hardware is ready
* Add charging status detection - when hardware is ready
* Stronger LED than the builtin one needed - add a WS2812B NeoPixel?

## Protocol & Infrastructure
* Finalize 7-byte Munin protocol implementation (currently partially implemented)
* Add proper error handling for malformed packets
* Implement device firmware update mechanism
* Add data persistence/backup for logged time
* Create proper installer/packaging for client app 
* Write a manual
